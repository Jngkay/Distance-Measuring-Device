# Distance-Measuring-Device

This activity creates a distance measuring device using the ultrasonic distance sensor. 
The goal of this activity is to light the LED RGB and turn on the buzzer on a specific distance. 

If the distance is less than 10 cm, the LED RGB will light a RED LED and a buzzer will turn on. 
Else if the distance is greater than or equal to 11 and less than or equal to 20, the LED RGB will light YELLOW LED
Else if the distance is greater than 21, the LED RGB will light GREEN LED. 

The distance is in cm and it will be shown to the LCD 16x2
